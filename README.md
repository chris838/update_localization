# update_localizations.py

A Python Script that helps dealing with localizations in Xcode. It keeps track of Items that are already translated and doesnt replace them like genstrings does but appends new items. 

Moreover it is possible to specify extensions of files that should be scanned and to specify ignore patterns for Files that should be ignored

This version has been updated to use genstrings2. Install gentsrings2 from the DTLocalizableStringScanner submodule.
